                <p>Coupa makes it possible for purchasers and suppliers to connect and do business. We had a problem that suppliers often failed to complete their profile and so were unable to conduct business with purchasers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onboarding process involved providing info regarding business, financial, shipping, banking, identity, diversity and more. Our research found that all but the smallest businesses required information from several people or departments in order to complete the onboarding. Once left incomplete, the missing information was sometimes never completed.</p>

                <p>We provided options for onboarding. I provided a method for users to skip some steps if necessary but encouraged users to forward skipped steps to someone else in the company.</p>
